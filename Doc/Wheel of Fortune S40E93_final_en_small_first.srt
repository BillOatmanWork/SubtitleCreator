I'm retired. 37 years in the oil and gas

You play golf now, these things?

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
I do play golf.

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Yeah.

43
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
But I had a little story back.

44
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,480
I used to work at a golf course when
Tiger was five years old,

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,480
and we used to go out and play golf,

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
play rounds of golf with Tiger.

47
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Tiger who?

48
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Tiger Woods.

49
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Oh, okay.

50
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Tiger Woods.

51
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
I don't know golf all that well.

52
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Was he any good?

53
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Yeah, he was.

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
That's a fine view of it.

55
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520

I didn't mean to get you all excited
there.
